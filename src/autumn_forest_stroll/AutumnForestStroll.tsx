      You go out walking on a sunny afternoon in the fall. Wind <WaveWord>whooshes</WaveWord> and <WaveWord>bends branches</WaveWord> as gentle gusts are met by the impeding treeline. The needles of pine trees hiss and allow only piercing rays of slanting autumnal light through, dazzling your vision--a strain on your intention to search for the beauty of nature as the last bits of fall unravel day-by-day.

    <StageBasic>
      Losing focus of your goal and becoming lost in thought, your feet move instinctually and your head bobs to just miss the twigs and leaves that jut into the narrowing path. You've been here many times before, your feet reinforcing a pathway well worn by small wheels and transient deer. Crunch. Step. Duck. Crunch. The sound of snapping twigs is sharp and jarring against the odd, lingering respite between tides of wind.
    </StageBasic>
    <StageBasic>
      You stop, taken to a snowy recollection of the bitter cold and permeating wet that covered your body the winter prior.
