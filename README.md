# Express Yourself with Words

... and colors, and animations, and style! This is an experimental library for expressing dynamic environments and stories textually.

I believe that stylization and convention can be used to increase the richness of a reader's experience with a piece of writing. This is motivated by my experience playing multi-user dungeons (MUDs), which are text-based, multiplayer games that sometimes produce a flurry of pages of action text describing what is happening around you. It can be overwhelming at first, but there is structure and color that eventually become familiar, so you start to have a genuine experience in that world. Much like a good book where you might be teleported to the scene that was set by the author, in a tone you've grown familiar with, by the power of your imagination.
